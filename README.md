# NBA-EDA-and-Model-Tuning

## Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning Model Tuning** on NBA player data to predict the number of single-game (PTS). We will make these predictions based on the numerical metrics in the dataset. The dataset is provided on Kaggle and was created by Eduardo Palmieri. The data set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eduardopalmieri/nba-player-stats-season-2425/data).

This repository includes two Jupyter notebooks:
- Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb
- model_and_model_tuning.ipynb

## Project Goal
- Understand the statisical relationship between NBA player features and total points scored
- Use regression techniques to **predict points** based on **numerical features**
- Tune advanced models to improve accuracy
- Evalute model performance using standard scoring metrics
